# 7.1 Setup classes

Create a class **Shape**
Let the classes Circle, Rectangle and Triangle inherit from the class Shape.

## Extra

1. Add one more class and let it inherit from Shape as well

2. Add one more base class that some of Circle, Rectangle, Triangle inherit from (but not all)

3. Let the Shape class be abstract. What is the effect?
